# **Des222 Task 2 - Journal**
## a responsive design for the real world
### Gareth Cheetham

### An Overview
My initial project idea was to explore the use of Rest API's and web development, wanting to expand on my coding portfolio after struggling with my Task 1 implementation.  
After exploring some public API's I discovered that NASA have public API's for a whole heap of different API's that you can explore and utilise. I knew immediately this could be interesting, the hardest part would be choosing a topic from their list that I could make someone else interested in aswell.

The following is a Process Documentation outlining how I'm building my Project.

### The Idea

The Mars Rovers have always facinated me. They're the modern version of astronauts, a millenial's explorer, and following their exploits scratches that itch of exploring the unknown. I feel that the Rovers all having names gives them their own personality and they become a certain kind of character, like the previous generation's Buzz Aldrin or Neil Armstrong. They can be someone you root for, showing an uncanny ability of humans able to project their traits on inanimate objects.

Currently on the surface of Mars, NASA has 4 rovers; Curiosity, Spirit, Opportunity and Perseverance. Each rover is in a different area and are each surveying the land and taking samples as well as an unbelievably large number of pictures. There are many ways NASA has developed to follow their journeys:

#### Access Mars
This is a neat project that is a rudimentary 360 experience that has stitched together images taken from Curiosity's landing zone that has a voice over that explains some interesting features of the Curiosity rover as well as a short animation explaining the Curiosity launch mission.
