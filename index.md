# **Des222 Task 2 - Journal**
## a responsive design for the real world
### Gareth Cheetham

### An Overview
My initial project idea was to explore the use of Rest API's and web development, wanting to expand on my coding portfolio after struggling with my Task 1 implementation.  
After exploring some public API's I discovered that NASA have public API's for a whole heap of different API's that you can explore and utilise. I knew immediately this could be interesting, the hardest part would be choosing a topic from their list that I could make someone else interested in aswell.

The following is a Process Documentation outlining how I'm building my Project.

### The Idea

The Mars Rovers have always facinated me. They're the modern version of astronaughts, a millenial's explorer, and following their exploits scratches that itch of exploring the unknown.
